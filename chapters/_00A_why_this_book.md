Looking back, it seems like so many things to do in just one year. When I share my wins, my output, often times I get this question: "How do you do so many things?". My goto answer has been: "I don't watch TVs, movies, which gives me a lot of time back".

While this is true, there are systematic changes I have done in mindset and routine. Some of these are absolute hacks by understanding how our mind works, how our body functions and tweaking it to get extreme productivity. This book is an answer to: "How can a seemingly non-achiever simple person get to do more without changing everything about his/her life?"

Tired of getting the same question, I made up my mind to write everything I do and has worked for me in a free ebook. Allow me to say that this has been an interesting challenge, initially I thought of just putting random thoughts and named this book: productivity pills. However, with time, I went and did more research about every chapter in this book. It made the chapters longer and thus we dropped the "pill" thing.

Let me give you a tour of my thinking process when the idea of writing this book crossed my mind, somewhere in November, 2019. I knew I was going to write whatever worked for me. But I was not sure whether that was the right thing to do or not, sometimes you get good results with bad technique as well. I went to one person I know who has read the most research and books on Productivity: Satyam Sir. Sir has been a constant motivation to lacs of students like me throughout his career. Even today, when I see his motivation and productivity hacks early morning on his FB page, I get my drive.

Sir is the epitome of simplicity and selfless life. While he's a physical education teacher at DAV, he is much more than that. Outside his teaching life, he has been an active social worker. During my school days, I was blessed enough to participate in many of his crusades. My idea with this book was not just to do your school right, or college or job right. Idea was to give you tools to succeed in your day job and at anything extra you want to, outside it too. Sir has been a perfect example of this too. Even though he is my teacher and we had a considerable age gap, we have been friends for as far as I remember.

Whenever I talk to him, I get to know about some more things he is doing after his teaching work. Last year, he completed his PhD. While people take 3-5 years fulltime to do this, he did it while working fulltime. Not only working, leading his school's volleyball team to innumerable wins over the year (which means he has to go for evening practice every day, after school hours). He has coached the coaches of CBSE schools. I call him master of masters, as a lot of his students like me are teaching or helping society while being experts in their respective fields. Pages will fall short if I keep writing about the impact he has made on his students or if I keep listing his achievements.

Anyway, I called him and asked him to help me in this. Despite his busy schedule, he agreed. I asked him to cross check my work, make sure that the tips and tricks I am sharing are not harmful in the long run. And then asked him to write a piece as well on the same topic. I very well knew that I can't cover everything there is and certainly Sir would add a lot more value to every topic. And boy! was I right about that. When I read the book now, Sir has brought a wholesome experience to every chapter. While I talk about productivity as a corporate thing with bars and stats, Sir brings in the human side, talking about how we can use the same principles to be a better friend, a better son, a better person, a better team player. For bringing these amazing insights, I thank him on behalf of all the readers of this book.

Now that you know why we wrote this book, we hope you get at least one thing out of it which helps you achieve your goal. Before moving forward, I would request you to read the next page about how to use this book well.
